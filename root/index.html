			<section name="myself"> <h2> Who am I?</h2>
			Hello, my name is Chris Bollard and welcome to my portfolio. In this portfolio you will get to know me through this about section you are reading
			right now! also contained in the portfolio is some of the work I have created over the last two years. It is important to note that this website
			uses JavaScript functions so ensure that you use a browser that supports the most up to date version of JavaScript. Now a bit more about me...

			I am currently 20 years old and have lived in Chester all my life. I went to Christleton High School for both high school and sixth
			form. As far as GCSE's go I managed to obtain eleven GCSE's ranging from grades B to D. Some of the best grades were in regards to maths, religous studies and personal
			finance. During my time in high school I enjoyed some of the activities we did in physical education as I had not heard or played them before. These
			activities included orienteering, ultimate frisbee & water polo. Also once a week I took part in a after school activity which was handball. I found
			this really enjoyable and found myself to be quite good at it. 
			
			At sixth form I studied a variety of subjects which were English Language, Business & IT as I felt it was important to keep my options open.
			The most liked subject at sixth form was English Language. This was because I could express myself and learn about the history of the language that
			I used.
			Through my experience at sixth form I chose a career path related to the IT industry and so decided to seek further education at West Cheshire College
			were I am currently studying. In my spare time I like to spend time with friends and family as well as go on bike rides. 
			
			In terms of my hobbies I like to keep up to date with the world of football. Not only do I like watching football on the TV but also playing it. I
			was in a 5 a side football team during sixth form.

			<section name="myskills"> <h2> My skills</h2>
			When I was thirteen I applied for a newspaper round for a local newsagents. I feel that this was a well taken oppurtunity because I have experienced the
			work environment from an early age. The newspaper round allowed me to gain skills such as working a routine, organisational skills and creating a strategy.
			
			The next time I was in a different work place environment was part of the work experience that I completed during high school. The work experience
			entailed myself working as an assistant caretaker at a block of flats. I picked up many practical skills as well as experiencing a new work environment.
			
			Throughout my time in education I have gained many valuable skills. The grades that I am most proud of are English Language and Computing which are A-Levels and a level 3 course respectively.
			As mentioned I have been studying IT at West Cheshire College for 2 years which I have picked up many skills. One skill I have picked up is leadership. This has been accomplished
			by being selected as the student rep for my course. This involved portraying any concerns, improvements or issues to members of staff. Throughout the two years of the course I have completed 18 different 
			units which covered a variety of both hardware and software. In particular they covered: websites, coding, databases, digital graphics & communication technologies.
			
			Another skill that I have picked up at college is being able to assemble a computer together. This was part of an assignment in which I took photos of each stage of the assembly.
			Yet another skill that I have picked up is being able to create and design websites. Part of unit 20 was to create the site that you are using! This unit was heavily focused
			on the client side customisation through the use of CSS and JavaScript.
			
			As part of the course I was sent out on work experience for one week. The experience took place in the IT department at the Countess of Chester Hospital.
			This experience covered many different areas of IT such as working on a helpline, fixing issues both with hardware and software and compling a spreadsheet 
			for a work rota.

			<section name="myaspirations"> <h2> My aspirations</h2>
			After my time studying this course at West Cheshire College I have many different paths open to me. The three main paths that I have are university, apprenticeship
			or employment. I am not looking to go to university at the moment because I feel that I need more time to adapt to a work environment. However, if in the future
			I feel that I want to expand my knowledge then I will definitly consider going. The other two options, apprenticeship and employment, are both similar however
			I would prefer an apprenticeship. This is because I am able to obtain money for later life as well as continuing the expansion of my knowledge.
			
			My aspiration in life is to sustain a happy and healthy lifestyle. This will come through a well paid job which I enjoy. I believe that this job will come through the IT industry. After this course it is likely
			that I will come into some form of employment as I'm looking to gain more work experience to get used to a work environment and routine. I have looked into the area of e-marketing which I believe is something 
			I have good knowledge of. I will be determined to work my way up into a higher position of the company. 
			
			I have believed in a quoute which is "Do what you love and you will never have to work a day in your life." -Confucius. This means that
			if you get a job doing something you like you will always see it as fun and not dull and boring which means you have to work past the boredom.
			
			In terms of aspirations besides work I would like to become more sociable. Through my time in education I have sometimes been socially awkward which
			is something I want to put in the past. I will be able to achieve this goal through going to new places to meet new people. Also, I could learn
			conversational skills so that I can establish and maintain a conversation.
